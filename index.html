This program responds to several commands listed in the word bank! The word bank 
  can be found in the upper left hand corner, alongside the map. You can toggle their 
  display on and off by clicking their buttons.<br><br>
  
To move around in and interact with the world, you can combine phrases from the word bank with 
 corresponding items. Items that can be interacted with will be in <b>bold print</b> and marked by an abbreviation
  in parenthesis. The abbreviation will let you know which phrase to type to interact.
  <br><br>
  
  <b>Example 1</b><br>
   You read: A lone bench shelters under the branches of several different <b>trees(E)</b>. <br>
           You type: examine trees<br> 
  You will type 'examine' because the E in <b>trees(E)</b> stands for 'examine' in the word bank. You will type 'trees' because 'trees' is in bold print. <br><br>
  
  <b>Example 2</b><br>
   You read: You can go <b>Northwest</b> to Paramecium Pond or <b>Up</b> to the Kettle.
  You type: northwest <br>
  -OR-<br>
  You type: up<br>
